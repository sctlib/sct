The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than
half the world’s population has been living in cities, and that share
is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030.

Cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic
growth—contributing about 60 per cent of global GDP. However, they
also account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over
60 per cent of resource use.

Rapid urbanization is resulting in a growing number of slum dwellers,
inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services (such as waste
collection and water and sanitation systems, roads and transport),
worsening air pollution and unplanned urban sprawl.

The impact of COVID-19 will be most devastating in poor and densely
populated urban areas, especially for the one billion people living in
informal settlements and slums worldwide, where overcrowding also
makes it difficult to follow recommended measures such as social
distancing and self-isolation.

The UN food agency, FAO, warned that hunger and fatalities could rise
significantly in urban areas, without measures to ensure that poor and
vulnerable residents have access to food.
