Plastic is over used, and deteriorates over time and contact with elements, sun rays etc.

Resulting micro-plastic, and general plastic waste & trash, end up
destroying all environments, all organisms, and the whole food chain;
our health, the one of the planet, and these of every other livings.

In every single part of the planet and organisms, plastic can be found.

# Plastic free future

# Stop plastic usage today

- do not use anything that consumes plastic, by starting reducing our consumption drastically

# Alternatives to plastic

- nothing that is single used, except when the use-case requires it (medical?)
